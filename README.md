# financial_dashboard

This proyect builds a local aplication for financial markets users who need a visual interface to load their operations in different markets. In this version the app supports multiuser actions, simulates commissions based on standard rate of 0.75% and loads data to a simulated database. At the moment this is saved in a localstorage but I am working to make it save as a JSON data.


All the App has been built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SASS.
